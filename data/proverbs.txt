Wisdom is better than Strength

Appearances are often Deceitful

Too many Cooks spoil the Broth

Borrowed Garments never fit well

Longest way round, is the Shortest way home

The Brave suffer little, Cowards much

Where there is a Will, there is a Way

Man thinks he's wiser, God shows him his folly

The Rat that has but one hole is soon caught

Where one will not, Two cannot fight

A Change, but no relief

If you want a thing done, go if not, send

Let sleeping dogs lie

He that is warm, thinks all are so

He that would fish, must not mind getting wet

Much meat, much Malady

The master's eye does more work than his hands

Try the ice before you venture on it

A Stitch in time, saves nine

Penny wise and Pound foolish

Stop the beginning of Evil

A Friend in need, is a Friend indeed

Man's extremity, is God's opportunity

Necessity is the Mother of Invention

Hope for the Best, be prepared for the Worst

He that lies with Dogs, will rise with Fleas

Let other people's Quarrels alone

Safe Bind, safe Find

Haste makes Waste
